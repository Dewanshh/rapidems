We are creating aggregation system in ambulance services, i.e. to take
all the private ambulance service providers on a single platform. So, the problems behind this Startup Idea is
1.) Less awareness about ambulance service providers(i.e; very few people knows about ambulance service provider personally).
2.) No transparency is there in private ambulance services(i.e; They charge more money instead of prices set by govt.)
3.) Lack of live location accuracy of patient.
4.) Lack of awareness about blood in blood banks.
5.) Bookings received by call.
6.)Lastly, but the most critical problem is, Lack of rapid ambulance services.

Novelty/USP's:-
1.) Currently there is no aggregator in ambulance services.
2.) Reduction of time taking process in booking and reaching of ambulance.
3.) Live location for both user and ambulance.
4.) Nearest ambulance to you will save your life.
5.) Fully transparence system with prices set by govt.
6.) Data of blood availability from blood banks will be available to user.
7.) Rapid Ambulance Service with four alternatives: 1. Basic life support Ambulance 2. Advance life support Ambulance 3. Patient transport vehicle 4. Medical Utility Vehicle.
